Every minute counts!
Darkness lies ahead, but someone must carry the light!
Your life has meaning!
Unleash your potential!
Perhaps fear doesn't rule me yet!
Energy flows around you!
A free soul knows no oblivion!
One more attempt!
First time?
Too early to give up, too late to retreat!
Meaning is found along the way!
True courage exists only where there's madness!
A man makes choices, a slave obeys!
You'll change many things - start today!
Time plays against you...
Sacrifice some fanaticism - it won't hurt!
Doubt is the worst enemy!
A storm is coming...
One day you'll understand everything...
Bioinformatics is the essence of your love!
Ignorance always has more confidence than knowledge!
All things pass...
Will you leave too?
You won't become who you were before...
But would you even want to?
Alienation isn't a bad option...
Even a dead end may bring opportunities...
The final outcome is sad...
But I just need more time!
You can find a path even when you can't see where you're going...
Suffering? Torment? Pain? All temporary...
Triumph is eternal!
I am a ray of light! Warm, bright, unwavering!
You can't sleep now! Drowsiness is worse than death!
Two steps forward, one step back...
Behold - your war dance!
Madness... You know what? I like it!
Scream! Let your cry spill upon the earth!
Knowledge is everything!
Mistakes create meaning and shape who you are...
Everything has its price!
The question is only when you'll pay it...
Don't waver!
Now's the time!
Nothing lasts forever...
Into battle? Or homeward?
I am the instrument of vengeance!
Who's next?!
Chances still exist...
The world doesn't end at the edge of your emotions or sight.
